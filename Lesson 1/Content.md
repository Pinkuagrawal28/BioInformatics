## Target Audience

- Beginner, Mid-level Programmers, interested in switching to something more interesting than generic programming and learning by solving interesting problems in biology.
- Biology and biochemistry people, with no CS, with Some programming experience, interested in learning how they can process genomic and other types of data using Python.
- We will not cover programming basics, as there are many amazing free courses online(listed at the end and in the video description), but we will look at some code optimizations when applicable and just focus on solving problems in bioinformatics.

## Prequisite

- Basic Knowledge of Python or any other programming language of your choice. That said, we will use some very specific Python (pythonic) code in the future.
- Code Editor and Python 3+ (Vscode, Atom, etc)

## My Interest and Experience in Bio

- I have been a professional programmer for 8+ years. I worked with VR, Embedded systems, Graphics, and Rendering. At the moment I am switching to the bioinformatics field to work in longevity research( Cell Signaling, Genome Sequencing, NGS).

## Video Series Sturcture

- We will start by learning about DNA and How we can represent and structure it in code, and write a set of functions and/or classes to perform fundamental operations on DNA Strings (Genome sequences).
- When We will have a basic set of tools with DNA STrings, we will start looking at more complicated algorithms that will help us find patterns in Genome Sequences (DNA Strings) even when mutations are introduced.
- We will write code that will access Genomics and protein databases to pull information from and look at different database formats and how to work with them.
- We will be solving Rosalind's Challenges and earning achievement badges as we go along.
- I will also be reviewing some related resources, books, and courses as well as some interesting research in longevity and cell biology.

## Communication

- For in-depth discussions, we will use:
  - Telegram :
  - Matrix :
- For Quick questions and comments:
  Youtube Comments section
